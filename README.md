# Random Scripts
Compilation of random scripts that could be useful for different situations

## secret_santa.py
This script automates the process of organizing a Secret Santa gift exchange. It takes a list of participants and their email addresses, and optionally a list of couples, to ensure that no one is assigned to themselves or their spouse. The script then sends out emails to each participant informing them of their assigned recipient.
### Features
* Prevents self-assignment and assignment to spouses.
* Sends email notifications through Gmail.
* Uses App Passwords for secure authentication.
### Note
* You'll need to create an App Password in your Gmail account settings and use that instead of your regular password.
* Make sure to delete the App Password after you're done using the script for security purposes.
